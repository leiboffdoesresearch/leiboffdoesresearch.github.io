---
Although many flowering plants produce fully fertile bisexual flowers, maize produces two types of flowers in difference places on the plant: flowers in the ear contain carpels, floral organs that form the grain, and flowers in the tassel contain stamens, floral organs that release pollen. Early in flower development, flowers from the tassel and ear are indistingishable and contain both stamens and carpels. Hormone and genetic pathways act to repress stamens in flowers in the ear and suppress carpels in the tassel. Although a few genes are known to regulate this suppression, we are working to understand the coordinatiated way that carpel cells in the tassel are suppressed and the gene expression changes that come along with sex determination in maize and other grasses.

In this project, we will expand the list of genes with known roles in carpel suppression through high throughput sequencing and genetic mapping of classic maize mutants with *tasselseed* phenotypes. We will use hormone treatments and genetic interaction studies to determine how carpel suppression genes are ordered into genetic networks. And in collaboration with the lab of Dr. Madelaine Bartlett (Sainsbury Lab, Cambridge University, UK) we will test the hypothesis that a common genetic mechanism regulates carpel suppression across multiple grasses. 

This project will provide fundamental knowledge for ensuring resilient and prosperous agricultural systems in the U.S. Carpel suppression genes represent promising targets to increase yield in maize and in its climate resilient relatives in the Panicoideae. The discoveries we make can be translated to other crops, to be rigorously evaluated in yield trials.
