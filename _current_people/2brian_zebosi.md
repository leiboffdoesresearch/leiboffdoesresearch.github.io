Dr. Brian Zebosi is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State Unversity's Department of Botany and Plant Pathology. Dr. Zebosi earned a PhD from Iowa State University under the supervision of Dr. Erik Vollbrecht studying the genetics of hormonal mutants in maize. As a postdoc in the lab, Brian is working to understand gene expression of sex determination in maize flowers by cloning and characterizing novel *tasselseed* mutants. Brians's work involves gene mapping by whole genome sequencing, single cell transcriptomics, and lots of field genetics. Brian is co-mentored by and collaborates with [Dr. Madelaine Bartlett (Sainsbury Lab, Cambridge, UK)][BartlettLab_website]{:target="_blank"}.
