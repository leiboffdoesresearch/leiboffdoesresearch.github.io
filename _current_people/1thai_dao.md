Dr. Thai 'Dat' Dao earned a PhD from UC Berkeley's Department of Plant and Microbial Biology under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Fletcher studying the effect of *CLE* peptides on stem cell maintainence in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. As a postdoc in the lab, Dat is developing fluorescent hormone sensors to compare hormone biology across agricultural grass species. Dat's work involves molecular cloning, bioengineering (particle bombardment), plant anatomy, and lots of microscopy.  

Dat is a skilled [scientific illustrator](https://datillustrations.com/) and is open to new collaborations for scientific communications projects.
