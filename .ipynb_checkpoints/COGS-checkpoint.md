![alt text][COGS]{:style="float: left;height="100%" width="100%"} Continuous Ontogentic Gradient Sampling (COGS) RNAseq is for keeping developmental time and comparing the formation of complex structures between related genomes. We carried out COGS RNAseq to compare the development of maize (*Zea mays* subsp. *mays* L.) tassels and sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor* L. Moench) panicles.

Although these two related grasses share a common ancestor ~12 million years ago, the shape, size, and complexity of their infloresences are distinct. As they grow and develop, the appearance, or morphology of maize and sorghum infloresences becomes almost unrecognizable but through COGS RNAseq we can compare the relative timing of developmental events in both species.
