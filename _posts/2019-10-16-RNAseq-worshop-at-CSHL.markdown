I had a blast teaching at the Cold Spring Harbor [Workshop on Cereal Genomics][cerealgenomics]! [Andrea Eveland][eveland] from the Donald Danforth Center Plant Science Center gave an amazing lecture on all the ways that gene expression data can inform plant science. Then we did a hands-on command line RNAseq analysis-- from raw reads to developmental inference. You can find the course materials [here][gitrepo].
