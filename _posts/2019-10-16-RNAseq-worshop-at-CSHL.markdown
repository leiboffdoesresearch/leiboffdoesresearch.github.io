I had a blast teaching at the Cold Spring Harbor [Workshop on Cereal Genomics][cerealgenomics]! I couldn't stay for long, but [Dave Jackson][jackson], [Doreen Ware][ware] and [Sarah Hake][hake] put together a great class with a great diversity of students and cutting-edge lecturers! I helped out with the class on gene expression. [Andrea Eveland][eveland] from the Donald Danforth Center Plant Science Center gave an amazing lecture on all the ways that gene expression data can inform plant science. Then we did a hands-on command line RNAseq analysis-- from raw reads to developmental inference. You can find the course materials [here][gitrepo].
