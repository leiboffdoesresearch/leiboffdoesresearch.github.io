There was sun, there was rain, but these folks smiled through the whole thing. Super excited to get our field planted. This is going to be a weird one! Hundreds of interesting maize mutants and diverse corn and sorghum from around the world. So many hopes and dreams for all these little kernels. Hope they do great!
