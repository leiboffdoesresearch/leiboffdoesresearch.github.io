![alt text][sam]{:style="float: right;height="50%" width="50%"} Sam Leiboff is an Assistant Professor in the Oregon State University's [Department of Botany and Plant Pathology (BPP)](http://bpp.oregonstate.edu){:target="_blank"} in the College of Agricultural Sciences. The Leiboff lab (est. 2020) is currently located at Room 3618 [Cordley Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ejQSn2syf52MEo2a7){:target="_blank"} and has many opportunities for new students, postdocs, and collaborators. Come say hi!

Sam uses quantitative genetics, transcriptomics, network biology, and molecular genetics to explore the way that maize (*Zea mays* subsp. *mays* L.), sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor* L. Moench), and a few other plants create inflorences and leaves.

Previously, Sam was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Plant Gene Expression Center / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. He was supervised by [Prof. Sarah Hake, USDA / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/shake){:target="_blank"} and worked on understanding gene regulatory mechanisms that control plant morphological events. Before that, he got his PhD in Plant Biology at [Cornell University's School of Integrative Plant Science](http://sips.cals.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Michael J Scanlon](http://scanlonlab.plantbio.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
