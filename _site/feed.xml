Super excited to get our field planted. This is going to be a weird one! Hundreds of interesting maize mutants and diverse corn and sorghum from around the world. So many hopes and dreams for all these little kernels. Hope they do great!&lt;/p&gt;

I helped out with the class on gene expression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danforthcenter.org/scientists-research/principal-investigators/andrea-eveland&quot;&gt;Andrea Eveland&lt;/a&gt; from the Donald Danforth Center Plant Science Center gave an amazing lecture on all the ways that gene expression data can inform plant science. Then we did a hands-on command line RNAseq analysis– from raw reads to developmental inference.
