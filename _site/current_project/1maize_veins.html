    <p>
      <p>A dense network of veins is critical for efficient photosynthesis in all land plants. Grasses that use C4 photosynthesis, like maize and sorghum produce an extremely dense network of veins in their leaf tissue. Although most veins are similar in structure, these repeated events provide a unique opportunity for specialization amongst tissues generated at different times and locations. We are working to understand the genes that control these specialized vein subtypes and whether similar tissues within an organism can be constructed for different purposes.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis we are using live cell imaging and single cell transcriptomics to track and identify key fate-determining factors in developing leaf vein subtypes amongst all developing leaf cells. In collaboration with the lab of Dr. George Chuck at UC Berkeley, we are mapping and functionally characterizing maize specialized vascular mutants, many with <em>wilted</em> phenotypes. We predicted vascular phenotypes from tens of thousands of cleared leaf images by first constructing a convolutional neural net (CNN) to classify pixels from leaf images. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 760 maize varieties from around the world, to map new genes and alleles correlated with specialized vascular development and discover the secret genetics of maize veins.</p>

<p>Data derived from these aims will inform the precision breeding of specialized vascular traits for the continued improvement of maize to meet global demand for food, feed, and fuel.</p>
