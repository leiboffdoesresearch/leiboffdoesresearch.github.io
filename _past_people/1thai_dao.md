Dr. Thai 'Dat' Dao worked as a postdoc in the lab from 2020-2022. Dat's research focused on the use of genetically-encoded fluorescent hormone sensors to compare hormone biology across agricultural grass species. Dr. Dao previously earned a PhD from UC Berkeley's Department of Plant and Microbial Biology under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Fletcher studying the effect of *CLE* peptides on stem cell maintainence in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Dat's work involved molecular cloning, bioengineering (particle bombardment), plant anatomy, and lots of microscopy.  

Dat is a skilled [scientific illustrator](https://datillustrations.com/) and is open to new collaborations for scientific communications projects.
