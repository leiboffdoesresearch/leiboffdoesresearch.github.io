Rachel Baschieri earned an MSc at Oregon State Unversity's Department of Botany and Plant Pathology in 2022. Rachel's research focused on live time-course imaging of maize and sorghum protoplasts and their response to the plant hormone gibberilic acid, summarized in [this protocol for transfection and time-course imaging in alginate](https://www.protocols.io/view/time-course-live-imaging-of-maize-and-sorghum-prot-4r3l27me3g1y). Rachel also worked on identifying genes involved in natural diveristy of sorghum inflorescences, performing physiological experiments using greenhouse and field hormone treatments. Before joining the lab, Rachel earned a BSc in Horticultural Sciences at Unversity of Florida.
