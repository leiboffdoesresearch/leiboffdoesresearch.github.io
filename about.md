![alt text][sam]{:style="float: right;height="50%" width="50%"} Sam Leiboff is an Assistant Professor at Oregon State's [Department of Botany and Plant Pathology (BPP)](http://bpp.oregonstate.edu). The Leiboff lab will open in May of 2020 and has many opportunities for new students, postdocs, and collaborators. How exciting!

Previously, Sam was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Plant Gene Expression Center / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/).
He was supervised by [Prof. Sarah Hake, USDA / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/shake) and worked on understanding gene regulatory mechanisms that control plant morphological events. Before that, he got his PhD in Plant Biology at [Cornell University's School of Integrative Plant Science](http://sips.cals.cornell.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Michael J Scanlon](http://scanlonlab.hmmmmmm.com)

Sam uses quantitative genetics, transcriptomics, network biology, and molecular genetics to explore the way that maize (*Zea mays* subsp. *mays* L.) and sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor* L. Moench) create inflorences and leaves. He is supported by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation, National Plant Genome Initiative, [IOS-1612268](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1612268)
