![alt text][sam]{:style="float: right;height="50%" width="50%"} Sam Leiboff is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Plant Gene Expression Center / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/).
He is supervised by [Prof. Sarah Hake, USDA / UC Berkeley](http://pgec.berkeley.edu/shake) and is interested in
understanding gene regulatory mechanisms that control plant morphological events.
Sam uses quantitative genetics, transcriptomics, network biology, and molecular genetics to explore the way that maize (*Zea mays* subsp. *mays* L.) and sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor* L. Moench) create inflorences and leaves. He is supported by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation, National Plant Genome Initiative, [IOS-1612268](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1612268)
